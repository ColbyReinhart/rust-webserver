				<p>
					Symplyfy is an attempt to make computing easier
					for those who cannot keep up with today's
					ever-demanding technological world. Symplyfy
					is an electron application made in raw
					html/css/js which acts as an overlay on a
					windows environment to create an easier and
					simpler experience for those who want to
					use a computer but are not proficient at
					using one. The key design principles are
					simplicity, restriction, intuition, and
					assistance.
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked on this project as part of the
					Choose Ohio First scholarship program
					between Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 with
					a group of three other undergrad students.
					Symplyfy won the best presentation award
					at the Choose Ohio First Research Symposium
					at Cleveland State University in April 2022.

					<h2>Webserver From Scratch</h2>

				</a>

				<p>
					Not only did I code this webserver from scratch in C using only
					C standard libraries, but it is also what this website is hosted
					from! "Webserver from Scratch" is my attempt at building my own
					personalized webserver. It started out very bare-bones, only
					capable of get requests with no parameters and had only the
					most essential security features. However, I've been building it
					up over time and hope that someday it will become quite
					sophisticated.
				</p>
				<p>
					This webserver works with raw sockets and uses a servlet structure
					to give specialized functionality for each page it serves, allowing
					support for dynamic web applications and customizeable RESTful APIs.
					I hope to extend this functionality in the future to create my own
					miniature web framework.

					<h2>Netpong</h2>
				</div>

				<a class="githubLink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ColbyReinhart/netpong">

				</a>

				<p>
					Netpong is a simple TUI multiplayer pong game written in C
					using the curses library. The program can be ran in server
					mode to host a game and in client mode to join a game.
					When the game begins, each player assumes one side of the
					court. Just like regular pong, the goal for each player is
					to keep the ball from passing their paddle. The player with
					the most points after a certain number of rounds wins!
				</p>
				<p>
					This program was done as a project for my Systems Programming
					course in college. The multiplayer functionality is achieved
					through raw sockets. This program also implements the
					<a target="_blank" href="/projects/SPPBTP.pdf">
					Simple Ping Pong Ball Transfer Protocol</a>,
					meaning it is compatible with others also implementing it.
