					<h2>Virtual Reality Tour</h2>
				</div>

					Or take the tour for yourself!
				</a>

				<p>
					The Kent State Virtual Reality Tour aims to
					provide a virtual experience for those who wish
					to visit different departments on Kent State
					University campus. Additionally, the tour provides
					a suite of tools and a login system which allows
					admins to add to, delete from, or otherwise edit
					the tour directly from the client. As part of my
					undergraduate capstone project, my task was to
					take an existing but unfinished  and messy codebase
					for this project, learn how it functions, and
					fix/improve upon it as much as possible. I worked
					with a team of four other students for this endeavor,
					which was my largest undertaking so far at the time.
					Although we could not even come close to fixing
					many of the tour's issues within the allotted time
					we had, we were able to drastically improve the user
					experience and thus improve the image of the Kent
					State CS department.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project consists of three main portions:
					a client application which is served
					to the user using WebGL, a webserver which delivers
					the tour and hosts a communication API, and a database
					which provides resources, data, and assets which the
					tour needs to function. The client was developed in Unity
					with C# scripting, the server was developed in C# using
					ASP.NET, and the database ran MySql/MariaDB. The server
					and database were both hosted on a university-provided
					virtual machine running Ubuntu.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this project I functioned as team leader and gained
					valuable experience in how to manage a team and cooperate
					towards a goal efficiently and effectively. I mainly worked
					on the client and API, but my contributions touched all
					aspects. My largest contribution was implementing functionality
					to prevserve cardinal orientation when moving between locations,
					which I did by manually mapping out north in each location,
					creating a database field to hold this data, and coding some math
					when transitioning between locations to preserve the correct
					orienatation between locations with arbitrarily-facing camera
					directions.

				</a>

				<p>
					Symplyfy is an attempt to make computing easier
					for those who cannot keep up with today's
					ever-demanding technological world. Symplyfy
					is an electron application made in raw
					html/css/js which acts as an overlay on a
					windows environment to create an easier and
					simpler experience for those who want to
					use a computer but are not proficient at
					using one. The key design principles are
					simplicity, restriction, intuition, and
					assistance.
				</p>
				<p>
					I worked on this project as part of the
					Choose Ohio First scholarship program
					between Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 with
					a group of three other undergrad students.
					Symplyfy won the best presentation award
					at the Choose Ohio First Research Symposium
					at Cleveland State University in April 2022.

					<h2>Webserver From Scratch</h2>

				<a class="githubLink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ColbyReinhart/webserver-from-scratch">
					See it on GitHub
				</a>

				<p>
					"Webserver from Scratch" is my attempt at building my own
					personalized webserver. I coded this webserver from scratch in
					C using only C standard libraries and system calls. It started
					out very bare-bones, only capable of get requests with no
					parameters and had only the most essential security features.
					However, I've been building it up over time and hope that someday
					it will become quite sophisticated.
				</p>
				<p>
					This webserver works with raw sockets and uses a servlet structure
					to give specialized functionality for each page it serves, allowing
					support for dynamic web applications and customizeable RESTful APIs.
					I hope to extend this functionality in the future to create my own
					miniature web framework.

					<h2>Netpong</h2>
				</div>

				<a class="githubLink" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ColbyReinhart/netpong">
					See it on GitHub
				</a>

				<p>
					Netpong is a simple TUI multiplayer pong game written in C
					using the curses library. The program can be ran in server
					mode to host a game and in client mode to join a game.
					When the game begins, each player assumes one side of the
					court. Just like regular pong, the goal for each player is
					to keep the ball from passing their paddle. The player with
					the most points after a certain number of rounds wins!
				</p>
				<p>
					This program was done as a project for my Systems Programming
					course in college. The multiplayer functionality is achieved
					through raw sockets. This program also implements the
					<a target="_blank" href="/projects/SPPBTP.pdf">
					Simple Ping Pong Ball Transfer Protocol</a>,
					meaning it is compatible with others also implementing it.
