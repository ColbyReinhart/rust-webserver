				<p>
					I started my internship at discount drug mart
					the summer after my freshman year in college.
					My position here mainly involved developing
					webapps, java solutions, and cash register
					developing in C++. Some of my more notable
					projects included a robust item lookup
					system known as "SPA" and a shelf tag printing
					program built on the java PDFBox library.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tech stack I wored with here was very large
					and often continued to grow as needed for
					individual projects.

					During my studies at Kent I participated in the

						Choose Ohio First Scholarship Program

					all four years. Choose Ohio First (COF) is a
					scholarship program which is offered to students
					in STEM majors. It's main two component include
					attending seminars related to emerging and
					enriching STEM topics and completing an annual
					team-based research project which is presented
					at a research symposium at the end of each school
					year. Sadly the 2020 research symposium was
					cancelled because of COVID, but my group presented
					and received the best presentation award for the
					years 2020-2021 and 2021-2022.

					During my time at Kent State I also participated
					in HacKSU, which is a student-led computer science
					organization sponsored by the university which
					hold weekly lessons taught by volunteer students.
					Lesson topics include introductions to new
					languages and technologies, resume workshops/mock
					interviews, software application workshops,
					and general computer science lessons beyond the
					curriculum taught at Kent State.
